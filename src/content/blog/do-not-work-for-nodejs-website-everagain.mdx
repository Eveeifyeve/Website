## DO NOT WORK FOR NODEJS WEBSITE EVERAGAIN


There are many reasons why and here I am explaining them..


### Issue with AvIv KeLLeR & OvFlOweD as a Node Fucking JS website maintainer!


Welp long time ago one of the very few us wanted to contribute to the NodeJS to fix their asynccode [ahm4dd that wanted to fix the described "Callback hell" in the codebase](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/pull/7972).

However we met the first issue with Aviv Keller with the PR Absoulute not taking the jokes.
He is been a maintainer since 2024 first clue AvIv doesn't have a clue of maintaining node js website.

He can't clealy take jokes in that pr.

[AvIv KeLLer is trying to make it editorial](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/pull/7972#issuecomment-3064295230).


### Why Node JS Becoming editorial and is it bad?

Because Aviv couldn't get a simple joke that was going to be published.
Here is the pr for those people who want to take it into better hands: https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/pull/7972

It is bad for a number of reasons:

- It gives them full control and what gets published and what doesn't.
- It gives them access to say no and completely blocks good prs with a change up to be published.
- It also hurts the nodejs reputation of being judgemental to only a few people and not an open team.
- Hurts the opensource community from contributing code afraid that it's going to get rejected.

Because the PR gives them loopholes to control the outright block content as well quality.

## Thankyou for reading it please share this thoughout social media to spread attention on people to hopefully replace both people on the team or completly remove the ability to become editorial.

Till then please DO NOT WORK ON NODEJS WEBSITE!
