I just intoduced the best resources for nix ever!

I created a special website to open those tedious resources that you open multiple times.
It offers keyboard bindings out of box like nix to go to nix manual. All keybinds are marked in ().


If you are using keyboard bindings make sure you disable programs like vimium on [nix-resources] page.

It is now avaliable via [here][nix-resources]. I highly suggest bookmarking this endpoint to zen or what ever browser you use.

[nix-resources]: /nix-resources
